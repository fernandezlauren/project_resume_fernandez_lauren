        <h2>Get to know Lauren:</h2>
        <p> Lauren Fernandez is a 21-year-old professional starting her career in marketing & communications with maslansky + partners. Lauren is the oldest of four siblings (exactly nine minutes older than her twin brother), a Florida native, and a current New Yorker. In her free time, she loves to travel, visit family, find new music, and compensate for the cold with lots of hot yoga. Lauren graduated with her bachelors in three years, and is currently finishing her masters. Her design and coding skills have aided her in filling a role as part-time creative manager at her current job. She effectivley communicates with and manages freelance designers to create professional collateral for her agency. In the future, Lauren is looking forward to rolling out her first full-length marketing campaign at maslansky + partners. She is also looking forward to traveling to Florida for some beach time and her younger brother Aidan's high school graduation. Lauren's favorite quote is "I want to know more so that I can be a better human being" by Maya Angelou.
